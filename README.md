<img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIG4.R20x82Gli5JgqYRN1TUp&pid=ImgGn">


**Powdery mildew**, a fungal disease affecting various plant species, particularly impacts cherry trees. This disease is caused by ascomycete fungi from the Erysiphales order, and it manifests as distinct white, powdery patches on leaves and stems. While primarily targeting lower leaves, it can affect any above-ground part of the plant. The disease is driven by high humidity and moderate temperatures, often thriving in greenhouses and other moist environments. As the disease advances, the white spots enlarge, becoming denser with the growth of asexual spores, potentially spreading across the plant.

For agricultural applications, early identification of this disease is crucial. Powdery mildew threatens crops, and timely intervention is key to maintaining plant health and production quality. Control measures typically include fungicide treatments, both conventional and bio-organic, as well as breeding for genetic resistance.

**Objective**: The goal of this project was to build an ML model capable of identifying powdery mildew in cherry leaves, achieving an accuracy rate of at least 97%. My model surpassed this target, reaching 100% accuracy in distinguishing between infected and healthy leaves.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge faced by **Farmy & Foods**, a client struggling with powdery mildew on their cherry plantation. The task involves visually differentiating between healthy leaves and those infected with the disease, which traditionally requires extensive manual inspection. By leveraging machine learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we aim to automate this detection process, saving time and reducing human error.

The dataset for this project was sourced from [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves), containing over 4,000 images from the client's cherry trees, both healthy and affected by powdery mildew. The images were collected from various farms, showcasing real-world conditions.

# Bugs

I encountered some issues during project deployment and testing. 

## Heroku:

During deployment, I encountered several issues. While my app worked as expected on Streamlit, I faced compression issues when deploying to Heroku. This was resolved by using slugs and removing unnecessary, redundant files.

The business requirement was not met initially. I realized at the last minute that my model's accuracy was at 94%, whereas the minimum required and expected accuracy was 97%. To address this, I re-ran the necessary cells in my notebook to improve the model's performance during the fitting process. 

I believe the issue occurred during the first fitting, as my computer was overloaded at the time. The second attempt yielded better results, which I then implemented throughout the project.
